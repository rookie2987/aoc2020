# Day Three
Woke up late today with little motivation to complete the task but did it horrendously in java. 3 Days, 3 Languages and I'm already struggling to think of more

There is definitely a better way I could've done this but I'm not very familiar with Java and honestly I'm quite happy I managed to complete it in Java.

I quite like Java as a language but I see no use for it in the projects I work on.
